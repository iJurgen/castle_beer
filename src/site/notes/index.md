# Welcome to my travel blog!
# About Me

Hi! I'm Jurgen, a traveler, castle hunter, and beer enthusiast.

This blog is my digital collection of the places I’ve explored — especially historic castles, forgotten fortresses, scenic routes, and small towns off the beaten path.  
It's a mix of structured travel notes and personal impressions, created mostly for friends, family, and anyone curious about the quieter, older corners of Europe.

## 🧭 Why this blog?

I’ve always enjoyed taking notes after trips — where I went, what I saw, and what surprised me.  
This is my attempt to structure those memories and share some practical info in the process.

You’ll find:
- Castle profiles with photos and history
- Route suggestions based on my own travels
- Travel reports from specific days or moments
- Notes and tips I want to remember (or warn others about 😄)

## 🍺 About Beer

Along the way, I always try to sample the **local beer** — especially the sour, hell, IPA, or just plain weird ones.  
Sometimes I’ll add a short “beer log” to my travel reports, with:
- 📍 where I drank it
- 🍻 what it was
- ⭐ whether it’s worth hunting down again
